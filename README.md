****Mini Project on Statistical Analysis****

“In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice they are not” quoted by Albert Einstein. In this context, to give more practice, this project will help for better understanding the concepts of statistical analysis in real world problems. This project will make the learner to apply descriptive statistics and how to interpret the same for real world problems. It also makes you to enhance your skills in applying statistical techniques like hypothesis testing to the real world problems. 

The first problem statement focus on exploratory data analysis on a la liga cup (a football tournament). The dataset gives information on all the teams that have so far participated in all the past tournaments. It has data about how many goals each team scored, conceded; how many times they came within the first 6 positions, how many seasons they have qualified, their best position in the past, etc. You need to analyse the data to get useful insights on top teams, wining distribution etc.

The second problem statement helps in understanding and applying confidence interval to an healthcare related problem.

The third problem statement will make you to apply statistical techniques like design experiment and hypothesis testing on designing a golf ball and experimenting on coating of a golf ball will impact the distance it travels.
